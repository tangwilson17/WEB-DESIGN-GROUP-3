      It would be impossible to mention Nothern without taking a deeper look
      at the fabulous building that houses it.
      Almirante Reis, he could not have imagined that 108 years later someone
      would pick his plans, rebuild his masterpiece and complete his project.

  After witnessing the decline of its neighbourhood in the late twentieth
  century, and becoming home, guest house, retailer and even lottery shop,
  it is time for the building to turn into a hotel and finally boast the
  splendour of its fa√ßade, proud of its war wounds, ready to help
  Portuguese and foreigners fall in love with the city.

      A Charming 5* Luxury Hotel & Beautiful 
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      It would be impossible to mention 1908 Lisboa Hotel without taking a
      deeper look at the fabulous building that houses it. A 1908 award-winning
      building is reborn in XXI’s century Lisbon. When architect Adães Bermudes
      sketched the lot on the corner between Largo do Intendente and Av.
      Almirante Reis, he could not have imagined that 108 years later someone
      would pick his plans, rebuild his masterpiece and complete his project.
      After witnessing the decline of its neighbourhood in the late twentieth
      century, and becoming home, guest house, retailer and even lottery shop,
      it is time for the building to turn into a hotel and finally boast the
      splendour of its façade, proud of its war wounds, ready to help Portuguese
      and foreigners fall in love with the city.

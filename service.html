      <p>
        Hotel customer service is the care provided by hotels to guests before, during,
        and after their stay. Because hotels rely heavily on loyal customers and good word-of-mouth 
        marketing ,hotel customer training is an integral part of a hotel's customer service strategy.

        <p>
          Not every hotel can give its guests a luxury experience. But that‚Äôs OK; people don‚Äôt expect
          5-star treatment from a chain inn just off the expressway. They do, however, have certain 
          baseline requirements that all hotels can strive to meet. When you exceed these expectations, 
          you can boost guest satisfaction, improve customer retention, and see more repeat guests.         
          Here are eight best practices for providing great customer experiences.

      <h1 style="color:sienna;"> Make Customer Service Easy</h1>
        <p>
          Understanding the most frequently made requests makes it possible to quickly satisfy those 
          requests. If a hotel knows that many people will ask for an extra blanket or towel, provide 
          easy to find instructions in the hotel room for the best way to make those requests. 
          Similarly, email receipts sent to guests who‚Äôve checked out should include instructions for 
          the best way to dispute billing charges. Nobody likes to deal with issues like that, but 
          a little bit of work upfront can make it a lot less painful.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <h1 style="color:sienna;"> Ask The Right Question</h1>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs easier to provide the best hotel customer service when you have the right information. 
          Customer surveys are useful on many levels, but it‚Äôs also important to ask the right questions 
          at the right times. A post-stay emailed survey is a good opportunity to get feedback on the guest‚Äôs 
          trip. You can make post-stay surveys more exciting for guests by offering giveaway raffles for their 
          entry. For example, you could offer a discounted room rate or an upgrade on their next stay. This 
          lets guests know their feedback is important.
        </p>

    <blockquote>
      <h1 style="color:sienna;"> Understand Customer</h1>
        <p>
          Keeping track of who stays at the hotel, with tools like sign in forms, surveys, and email lists 
          can help hotels create experiences that meet their customer‚Äôs needs. Are they in a hurry and 
          need quick check in and check out, or do they want to take their time ‚Äî and have a chat about 
          the best local places to eat? Hotels will never know unless they endeavor to find out. Really 
          getting to know your guests will help you provide a better customer service experience. 
          A hotel brand needs to understand what its customers really want to deliver the right kind of 
          service. Only then can employees go beyond customer expectations to deliver service that
          is memorable.

                Room service is considered as an important issue in hotel industry. 
                It represents the wishes of guests, which were increased in recent years 
                as a result of guest desire of more luxury and time saving. It also represents 
                the desire of food and beverage managers in maximizing their department income.

                Room service is the epitome of hotel luxury. The novelty of being able to dine 
                in your own room, lounging around to your heart's content while being waited 
                upon by hotel staff appeals to many people, and they're willing to pay for it!
                Hotel room service has never been known for high-quality food—hotels have 
                restaurants for that. But, it's the opportunity to live like a movie star for the 
                day that really appeals to people, and if the food is also great, then even better.

                Room service delivers food from the onsite restaurant to a guest’s room.
                Unlike other delivery services, the staff provides all dishes, cutlery and trays.
                This allows guests to enjoy their meals in bed or at the table. Room service also 
                extends to alcoholic drinks. However, many hotels stock such beverages in the mini-fridge.

                Room service is a convenience. It allows guests to eat in privacy or outside of regular 
                restaurant hours. Most hotels take food orders throughout the day, accommodating late comers 
                and early risers. In many respects, room service also saves time. Guests can get ready in the 
                morning while their food is prepared. This avoids restaurant waits and reduces the time 
                between eating and starting the day.

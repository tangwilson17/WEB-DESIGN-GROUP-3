          Room service is considered as an important issue in hotel industry.
          It represents the wishes of guests, which were increased in recent years
          as a result of guest desire of more luxury and time saving. It also represents
          the desire of food and beverage managers in maximizing their department income.

          Room service is the epitome of hotel luxury. The novelty of being able to dine
          in your own room, lounging around to your heart's content while being waited
          upon by hotel staff appeals to many people, and they're willing to pay for it!
          Hotel room service has never been known for high-quality food‚Äîhotels have
          restaurants for that. But, it's the opportunity to live like a movie star for the
          day that really appeals to people, and if the food is also great, then even better.

          Room service delivers food from the onsite restaurant to a guest‚Äôs room.
          Unlike other delivery services, the staff provides all dishes, cutlery and trays.
          This allows guests to enjoy their meals in bed or at the table. Room service also
          extends to alcoholic drinks. However, many hotels stock such beverages in the mini-fridge.

          Room service is a convenience. It allows guests to eat in privacy or outside of regular
          restaurant hours. Most hotels take food orders throughout the day, accommodating late comers
          and early risers. In many respects, room service also saves time. Guests can get ready in the
          morning while their food is prepared. This avoids restaurant waits and reduces the time
          between eating and starting the day.

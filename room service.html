  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <small>
        Room service is considered as an important issue in hotel industry.
        It represents the wishes of guests, which were increased in recent years
        as a result of guest desire of more luxury and time saving. It also represents
        the desire of food and beverage managers in maximizing their department income.
      </small>
    </p>

    <p>
      <small>
        Room service is the epitome of hotel luxury. The novelty of being able to dine
        in your own room, lounging around to your heart's content while being waited
        upon by hotel staff appeals to many people, and they're willing to pay for it!
        Hotel room service has never been known for high-quality food—hotels have
        restaurants for that. But, it's the opportunity to live like a movie star for the
        day that really appeals to people, and if the food is also great, then even better.

    <p>
      <small>
        Room service delivers food from the onsite restaurant to a guest’s room.
        Unlike other delivery services, the staff provides all dishes, cutlery and trays.
        This allows guests to enjoy their meals in bed or at the table. Room service also
        extends to alcoholic drinks. However, many hotels stock such beverages in the mini-fridge.
      </small>
    </p>

    <p>
      <small>
        Room service is a convenience. It allows guests to eat in privacy or outside of regular
        restaurant hours. Most hotels take food orders throughout the day, accommodating late comers
        and early risers. In many respects, room service also saves time. Guests can get ready in the
        morning while their food is prepared. This avoids restaurant waits and reduces the time
        between eating and starting the day.
